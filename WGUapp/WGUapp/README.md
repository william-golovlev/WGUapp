# C971 Mobile Application Development Using C Sharp



## Changes explained:

Instead of having a main view/home screen, I decided to integrate
TermView and MainView together into one page. This means now
I only have two pages in my app instead of 3 like Wireframed. 

The design is still recognizable and familiar, it has just been
condensed and hence simpler to use. The biggest change may be the
the Terms strip near the top, and the view of a single term below it.

The courses page is almost identical to the wireframe, with the 
addition of a few small details: namely, swipe instead of buttons.
